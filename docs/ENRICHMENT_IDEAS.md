# Ideas for Enriching the Knowledge Base (Beyond the Website)

Possible additions to make the KB better:

- **Social APIs** – Pull bio and recent posts from LinkedIn/Facebook/Instagram (watch rate limits and ToS) to get more voice and themes.
- **Reviews** – Google Reviews, G2, Capterra etc. for testimonials and pain points where allowed.
- **Company data** – Clearbit, ZoomInfo, etc. for employee count, industry, geography when the site doesn't say.
- **Schema.org / directories** – Parse JSON-LD and listings (Google Business, Yelp) for hours, locations, categories.
- **Competitors** – Manual or tool-based to tag 2–3 competitors and positioning for content.
- **Blog/content crawl** – Light crawl of their blog to get recurring topics and keywords for themes.
- **Legal** – Scrape privacy/terms once in a while to pull disclaimer language for MoMail/MoBlogs.
- **Seasonal tags** – Let users or integrations add stuff like "Q4 promo" or "tax season" for timing.
- **Feedback** – After MoSocial/MoMail/MoBlogs generate content, let users say "use this tone again" or "avoid this" and update the KB.
- **Human review** – Flag low-confidence or empty fields for someone to fill or approve before the KB is "ready."
